        There are many resources out there for people to learn about quantum computing. However we would like to create a place where absolute beginners can start from, like a “start here” section that then takes them step-by-step through the process of understanding the minimum before exploring the world of quantum computing for themselves. The content will be a combination of original creations by the team and links to specific sections of already existing content.

        The Quantum Beginners Initiative was started to address the growing need for educational outreach in the field of quantum computing. Here are some reasons why such an initiative was launched:
