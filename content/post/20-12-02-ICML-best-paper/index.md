General motivation, postulates of quantum mechanics, Dirac notation
State Space and Superposition: Quantum systems are described by state vectors, represented by
complex numbers. The state vector represents the complete information about the system.
Quantum systems can exist in a superposition of states, where they can be in a combination of
multiple states simultaneously. Measurement and Observables: When a measurement is
7
performed on a quantum system, the outcome is one of the eigenvalues of the corresponding
observable”.

Each observable is associated with a Hermitian operator, and its eigenvalues
represent the possible measurement outcomes. Probabilistic Interpretation: The outcome of a
measurement in quantum mechanics is probabilistic. The probability of obtaining a specific
measurement outcome is given by the square of the absolute value of the corresponding
coefficient in the superposition state. Wave Function Collapse: After a measurement, the
quantum system collapses into one of the eigenstates associated with the measurement
outcome. This collapse is non-deterministic, and the probability of collapsing into a particular
state is determined by the coefficients in the superposition state. Time Evolution: Quantum
systems evolve over time according to the Schrödinger equation. The time evolution of a
quantum state is determined by the Hamiltonian operator, which represents the energy of the
system. Quantum Entanglement: Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more
particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle cannot be described
independently of the others. Entangled particles exhibit non-local correlations and can
influence each other instantaneously, even when separated by large distances. Quantum
Uncertainty: The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that there are inherent limitations to
simultaneously measuring certain pairs of observables, such as position and momentum, with
high precision. The more precisely one observable is measured, the less precisely the
complementary observable can be known.
Postulate 1: State of a system or the space of states The state of any physical system is specied,
at each time t, by a state vector |ψ(t)⟩ in a Hilbert space H; |ψ(t)⟩ contains (and serves as the basis
to extract) all the needed information about the system. Any superposition of state vectors is
also a state vector. Postulate 2: Observables and operators To every physically measurable
quantity A, called an observable or dynamical variable, there corresponds a linear Hermitian
operator Aˆ whose eigenvectors form a complete basis. Postulate 3: Measurements and
eigenvalues of operators The measurement of an observable A may be represented formally by
the action of Aˆ on a state vector |ψ(t)⟩. The only possible result of such a measurement is one of
the eigenvalues an (which are real) of the operator Aˆ. If the result of a measurement of A on a
state |ψ(t)⟩ is an, the state of the system immediately after the measurement changes to |ψn⟩:
Aˆ|ψ(t)⟩ = an|ψn⟩ Postulate 4: Probabilistic outcome of measurements Discrete spectra: When
measuring an observable A of a system in a state |ψ⟩, the probability of obtaining one of the
nondegenerate eigenvalues an of the corresponding operator Aˆ is given by Pn(an) = |⟨ψn|ψ⟩|2
8
⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = |an| 2 ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ 1 where |ψn⟩ is the eigenstate of Aˆ with eigenvalue an. Continuous spectra:
To determine the probability density that a measurement of Aˆ yields a value between a and a +
da on a system which is initially in a state |ψ⟩: dP(a) da = |ψ(a)| 2 ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = |ψ(a)| 2 R +∞ −∞ |ψ(a ′)|
2da′ Postulate 5: Time evolution of a system The time evolution of the state vector |ψ(t)⟩ of a
system is governed by the time-dependent Schrodinger ¨ equation ih¯ ∂|ψ(t)⟩ ∂t = Hˆ |ψ(t)⟩ where
Hˆ is the Hamiltonian operator corresponding to the total energy of the system.
