The young wizard in the Harry Potter universe was enrolled in Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry to study advanced magical theory.

One day, Harry heard about the Stern-Gerlach experiment while listening to a lecture on the characteristics of magical particles. (* an experiment conducted by muggles that assessed the quantized spin of subatomic particles) Harry was intrigued by the idea and pondered whether the
same ideas could be used to describe magical particles. Harry made the decision to run
his own experiment to verify his theory with the assistance of his friends Hermione and
Ron. They began by creating a beam of magical particles, consisting of spells and
potions, and passing it through a magnetic field. Before conducting the experiment,
they expected the particles to create a continuous smear on the detector screen (*based
on the classical physics prediction.

But to their surprise, the particles diverged into two distinct directions. Harry, amused
by the outcome, made the decision to find Stern and Gerlach to ask them further
questions about the experiment. The scientist said that the experiment was intended to
detect the silver atom's magnetic moment, but the discovery of spin during the
procedure led to the explanation for why the particles split into two distinct pathways.
When Harry enquired about the deflection of the particles in the magnetic field, Stern
and Gerlach responded that it was inversely correlated with the kinetic energy of the
particles. The amount of deflection and kinetic energy of the particles increased with
the strength of the magnetic field. By altering the strength of the magnetic field in their
experiment, Harry and his friends chose to put this notion to the test. They discovered
that the deflection of the particles grew according to their kinetic energy when the
field's strength was decreased. This outcome supported Stern and Gerlach's discovery of
a connection between deflection and kinetic energy. Harry and his companions
discovered that the concepts of kinetic energy and space quantization were related as
they continued their studies. They proposed that the quantized regions of the magnetic
field might modify the particle kinetic energy, resulting in various patterns on the
detector screen. For instance, they found that varying degrees of deflection and kinetic
energy resulted from the fact that particles with particular spins could only exist in
particular, quantized positions inside the magnetic field. They also found that the size
of the quantized units of space may vary depending on the strength of the magnetic
field, producing various patterns on the detector screen. As they continued to
experiment and gather data, Harry and his friends developed a greater understanding of
the properties of magical particles and the principles of muggle science. Their research
showed that the relationship between deflection and kinetic energy was a crucial factor
in understanding the behavior of particles. In the end, Harry's experiment not only
expanded his understanding of the properties of magic and the principles of muggle
science, but it also showed that the deflection of particles was inversely proportional to
their kinetic energy. Harry realized that the principles of space quantization and kinetic
energy had many applications in the field of magical engineering. He began to apply
these principles to his own magical inventions, making them more efficient and
powerful than ever before. The term "spin" refers to a quantum property of an atom or
subatomic particle that behaves as if it were spinning around an axis. However, the spin 
is not an actual rotation, but rather an intrinsic property that has no classical
counterpart. The Stern-Gerlach experiment demonstrated that the spin of an atom can
be measured by the deflection of its magnetic moment in an inhomogeneous magnetic
field. When a beam of atoms is passed through a region of strong magnetic field, the
spin of the atoms causes them to be deflected in a direction that depends on their spin
orientation. In particular, the experiment showed that the spin of an atom can only take
certain discrete values, corresponding to different quantized states. For example, in the
case of a silver atom, the spin can take only two possible values, +1/2 or -1/2, along a
given axis. The Stern-Gerlach experiment thus provided early evidence for the
quantization of angular momentum in quantum mechanics, and helped pave the way
for the development of spin-based technologies, such as magnetic resonance imaging
and spintronics.
