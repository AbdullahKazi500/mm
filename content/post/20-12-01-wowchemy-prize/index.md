What Is Quantum Computing?
In physics, a quantum (plural quanta) is the minimum amount of any physical entity (physical
property) involved in an interaction. So to understand that here is an example **Light consists
of photons. A single photon is a discrete packet of light which cannot be broken down into
smaller quantities. Light can be quantified as a given amount of these discrete packets.
Hence,the light that is propagated from one point in space to another is composed of many of
these individual photons” Quantum computing is focused on developing computational
technology based on the principles of Quantum Mechanics.

 In simpler terms, we can say that
Quantum computing is an area of study focused around the principles of quantum theory and
computing. Quantum computing is a field comprising aspects of computer science, physics, and
mathematics that utilizes quantum mechanics to solve complex computational problems. Why
do we need Quantum Computing ? Quantum Computing is gradually becoming a subject of
interest among researchers and technology enthusiasts. This is because it has the potential to
lead us to breakthroughs in several fields, including drug discovery, cybersecurity. The primary
reasons researchers are interested in Quantum Computing is the potential speedup Quantum
Computers could bring to many real-world computational problems. For example, factoring a
large integer n would take about O(e^(log(n)^1/3)) operations to complete on a classical
6
computer, whereas on a Quantum Computer, it would take exponentially fewer operations,
O(log(n)^2). O(n) is just a computer science way of saying that the time taken depends directly
on n, which is the large integer we are trying to factor. This was proved by Peter Shor in 1994. It
is now known as Shor’s Algorithm and has the potential to break down public-key encryption
(the protocols that make sure our emails and text messages are secure) provided we can build a
Quantum Computer with enough qubits. Shor’s algorithm is one example of what we call a
“quantum speedup” i.e. where it has been demonstrated that a quantum computer can solve a
task much faster than a classical computer can. Currently there are only a few such examples of
quantum speedups, but as more researchers enter the field, we are hopeful that we will find
more to come! On a more constructive note, director of engineering at Google, Hartmut Neven,
also noted that quantum computers could help build better climate models that could give us
more insight into how humans are influencing the environment[1]. Although Quantum
Computing is in its initial development we can predict some amazing new developments. What
is needed for the field of quantum computing to grow? Currently there are two main avenues of
research: (1) understanding how to physically build and engineer quantum computers to make
them bigger and better and (2) understanding how we could use these quantum computers to
solve real world problems much more efficiently than with the computers we have today.
However a large infrastructure is required to push this research forward,including increasing
quantum awareness and education. This can be at various levels, ranging from teaching
students the knowledge and skills they need to pursue a career in quantum research, to
educating business leaders, government entities and investors such that they can support and
invest in the growth of quantum computing.” Conclusion Quantum computers have the
potential to revolutionize computation by making certain types of classically complex & tough
problems solvable. While no quantum computer is yet sophisticated enough to carry out
calculations that a classical computer can’t, great progress is underway.
